    <h2></h2>
<p>(This is a W.I.P post)</p>
<h2>How I use YouTube</h2>
<p>As many already know, YouTube is highly flawed. You know it, I know it, Google know it. That's why, as of the past few months, YouTube has tried to be a bit more aggressive with advertising by attempting to block viewing videos if they detect you're using an ad blocker of some kind. Before this, they had also tried adding multiple 10 second ads before videos and for many years, ads have been put at various points of longer videos.</p>
<p>Of course, I would have never noticed this had it not made news on sites like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23950513/youtube-ad-blocker-crackdown-privacy-advocates-eu">The Verge</a> and on YouTube itself. Why wouldn't I have noticed? Because I don't use YouTube.</p>
<p>Well, I say "I don't use YouTube" but I still watch YouTube videos. What I mean is that I haven't used <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube.com</a> to watch videos for probably years at this point. With that, I haven't watched an ad before or after a video, I haven't been blocked from watching videos, I haven't even watched any of the ads YouTubers add into their videos such as sponsorships, self promotion etc.</p>
<h3>How??</h3>
<p>I use the following applications to watch YouTube videos:</p>
<p>On Desktop, I use <a href="https://freetubeapp.io/">FreeTube</a> and on Android, I use <a href="https://github.com/polymorphicshade/NewPipe">NewPipe</a>.</p>
<p>Install them and that's it. Just export your subscriptions from YouTube, import them to these applications, change settings to your liking and you're done.</p>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>No advertisements (At any point)</li>
<li>Downloading of videos within the clients (audio and/or video)</li>
<li>Open source software you can modify to your liking</li>
<li>No cookies, fingerprinting, tracking etc.</li>
<li>No algorithm to recommend videos you don't care about</li>
<li>You can use any video player you like</li>
<li>More choice in playback devices (lightweight clients)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are some of the common advantages between FreeTube and NewPipe. The individual clients have some of their own:</p>
<ul>
<li>FreeTube can be used with Invidious (which means you can have zero communication with Google services directly)</li>
<li>NewPipe can be used in the background (a "feature" you'd need to pay for in the official YouTube app.)</li>
<li>NewPipe can stream from Soundcloud, Bandcamp, FramaTube and media.ccc.de</li>
<li>FreeTube has profiles (you can create a profile for a particular group of channels for example)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>No synchronisation between devices</li>
<li>No interaction such as liking, commenting, reporting etc.</li>
<li>No algorithm to recommend videos you don't care about</li>
</ul>
<p>On NewPipe specifically, if you have a large number of subscriptions, refreshing the list to show new videos can take a few seconds. On FreeTube, this isn't an issue I've noticed.</p>
<h3>Other options</h3>
<p>These are only the apps <em>I</em> use for YouTube. There are plenty of other alternatives, particularly on Android:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://grayjay.app/">GrayJay</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SkyTubeTeam/SkyTube">SkyTube</a></li>
<li><a href="https://libretube.dev/">LibreTube</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and probably more...</p>
<h3>But this is stealing!!</h3>
<p>It's not. If you enjoy the videos somebody creates, donate to them directly or buy something they sell.</p>
