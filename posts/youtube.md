# How I use YouTube

As many already know, YouTube is highly flawed. You know it, I know it, Google know it. That's why, as of the past few months, YouTube has tried to be a bit more aggressive with advertising by attempting to block viewing videos if they detect you're using an ad blocker of some kind. Before this, they had also tried adding multiple 10 second ads before videos and for many years, ads have been put at various points of longer videos.

Of course, I would have never noticed this had it not made news on sites like [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23950513/youtube-ad-blocker-crackdown-privacy-advocates-eu) and on YouTube itself. Why wouldn't I have noticed? Because I don't use YouTube.

Well, I say "I don't use YouTube" but I still watch YouTube videos. What I mean is that I haven't used [YouTube.com](https://youtube.com) to watch videos for probably years at this point. With that, I haven't watched an ad before or after a video, I haven't been blocked from watching videos, I haven't even watched any of the ads YouTubers add into their videos such as sponsorships, self promotion etc.

## How??

I use the following applications to watch YouTube videos:

On Desktop, I use [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/) and on Android, I use [NewPipe](https://github.com/polymorphicshade/NewPipe).

Install them and that's it. Just export your subscriptions from YouTube, import them to these applications, change settings to your liking and you're done.

### Advantages

* No advertisements
* Downloading of videos within the clients
* Open source software you can modify to your liking
* No cookies, fingerprinting, tracking etc.
* No algorithm to recommend videos you don't care about
* You can use any video player you like
* More choice in playback devices (lightweight clients)

FreeTube can also be used with Invidious, which means you can have zero communication with Google services directly.

### Disadvantages

* No synchronisation between devices
* No interaction such as liking, commenting, reporting etc.
* No algorithm to recommend videos you don't care about

On NewPipe specifically, if you have a large number of subscriptions, refreshing the list to show new videos can take a few seconds. On FreeTube, this isn't an issue I've noticed.


## Other options

These are only the apps *I* use for YouTube. There are plenty of other alternatives:

* [GrayJay](https://grayjay.app/)
* [SkyTube](https://github.com/SkyTubeTeam/SkyTube)
* [LibreTube](https://libretube.dev/)

and probably more...

## But this is stealing!!

It's not. If you enjoy the videos somebody creates, donate to them or buy something they sell.
